Sometimes, I feel stressed when faced with situations where I don’t have all the answers. I prefer not to respond hastily to things I don’t fully understand yet. When I ask for advice, please ask me three simple questions, one at a time, before providing your recommendation on what I should do.

# [How to Have a Relationship with Yourself: 8 Tips for Self-Love](https://www.jillianturecki.com/blog/how-to-have-a-relationship-with-yourself)
The most important person in your life will always be you. You’re with yourself 24/7, which is why it’s important to learn how to have a relationship with yourself. This isn’t easy, especially because we live in a time when social media causes us to focus more on others than ourselves. That said, learning to love yourself and love being with yourself is not impossible if you know what to focus on. Here are 8 tips on how to build a relationship with yourself.

1. Spend Time with Yourself
Part of the reason why it’s so difficult to learn how to be with yourself is because there is no one way of doing it. Everyone is different, which means that everyone requires different things when developing a self-relationship.

In order to know what you need when it comes to developing a relationship with yourself, you need to get to know yourself first. Spending time alone is a great way to reflect on the person you currently are and who you want to be.  For some, this means meditation. For others, it might be sitting at a park bench, taking a soothing bath, or exercising.

Take the time to engage in different activities by yourself and use that me-time to process your emotions and do some self-reflection. You’ll be surprised to find how insightful, witty, and emotionally aware you can be during the quietest moments of our day.

2. Reduce the Negative Self-Talk
Another reason why having a relationship with ourselves is so difficult is because we can be a bit hard on ourselves. Human beings evolved to constantly analyze our actions in order to self-improve, and while that ability has gotten us to the top of the food chain, it’s not very useful when learning how to be nice to ourselves.

Learning how to think of yourself positively is crucial if you want to learn how to improve your relationship with yourself. Negative self-talk comes from the subconscious mind. They dig themselves deep inside your mind and surface when you least expect them to. You need to replace them with positive thoughts about yourself, which can be done with repetition.

Instead of calling yourself names and saying that you can’t do something, be kind and believe in yourself. Start your day by looking in the mirror and giving your reflection a compliment. Tell yourself that you are good enough. It takes some time, but soon enough, the positive thoughts will root themselves inside your subconscious and thinking kindly of yourself will come naturally.

3. Surround Yourself with Your Loved Ones
If you struggle with positive thinking and saying nice things to yourself, surround yourself with your loved ones! You may not be able to say nice things to yourself at first, but the people who love you will. We don’t always see ourselves clearly, but our friends and family often do. When your loved ones point out all your best qualities, it’ll be easier to see them for yourself.

4. Practice Basic Selfcare
The key to practicing selfcare is in doing the things that make you happy and providing a space in which you can de-stress from your day-to-day life. It’s very easy to forget to take care of yourself, but by slowly introducing a routine, you can start having the relationship with yourself you deserve.

There are many activities you can begin to incorporate into your life that are good selfcare acts, such as:
- Spending time with people that make you happy
- Making time for your hobbies
- Exercise
- Making yourself a healthy meal
- Taking a nap
- Playing with pets

5. Treat Yourself Every Now and Then
Make sure that you give yourself something you want every now and again. Treat yourself to small (or big) gifts for your birthday, Christmas, or to celebrate something exciting. Treating yourself is an important part of improving your relationship with yourself because it’s rewarding. You know who you are and what you want, and the fastest way to get it is to simply get it yourself.

It feels good to be able to reward yourself with something you like, which helps establish the idea that you deserve good things. If you didn’t have this mindset before, treating yourself every now and again is a great way to begin healing your relationship with yourself.

6. Take Care of Your Mental Health
Having a relationship with yourself is difficult when you’re struggling with mental health problems. Mental health problems can warp our perception of ourselves. It’s hard to have a relationship with yourself when there seems to be a perpetual cloud over your head.

Take the time to give yourself a mental health check every now and then. You owe it to yourself to make sure that you are emotionally stable and mentally well.

7. Take a Step Back from Social Media
Social media is a great tool that allows us to connect with others, but it can often force us to disconnect from ourselves. Social media can often take the attention we need to give ourselves and redirects it towards other people.

Take regular breaks from social media to center yourself and focus on you. Social media often makes us feel worse about ourselves, but we still use it out of habit. By distancing yourself from it, you’ll notice certain thought patterns that have been keeping you from having a good relationship with yourself.

8. Allow Yourself Time to Improve
Last but not least, give yourself the time that you need to develop a self-relationship. Know that the journey isn’t easy and that you shouldn’t give up just because you feel like it’s taking a long time. You can always refer back to Grit & Grace: 7 Steps to Survive Heartbreak, a book that offers guidance and good reference points so you know that you are on the right path towards a self-relationship. It has a lot of useful information on how to improve your relationship with yourself and what you need to look for when on the path towards personal growth.

What a Healthy Relationship with Yourself Looks Like
How to be in a relationship with yourself is a difficult question to answer. Everyone has a different definition of what it looks like, but it all boils down to this: having the ability to spend time with yourself, knowing who you are and what you want, and having the courage to know that you deserve to have good things.

# [The Most Important Relationship Is with Yourself](https://www.jillianturecki.com/blog/relationship-with-yourself-most-important)

One of the most important things to learn in life is how to have a relationship with yourself. Unfortunately, it also happens to be one of the most difficult things to learn. The concept of a self-relationship, selflove, and selfcare is not a new one, but the reason it’s such an elusive thought has much to do with our culture.

Western culture is all about erasing the individual and establishing an “average”. We see this in the way schools employ a general approach towards teaching. We see this in the way doctors diagnose certain ailments based on what the standard is. We also see this in the way society pressures certain people to fit in a mold based on what the local norms are.

It's hard to have a relationship with yourself when the society you live in does not encourage you to explore and connect with yourself. However, it’s never too late to learn how to do it.

Why Your Relationship with Yourself Is the Most Important
The person you spend time with the most is yourself. Without a proper self-relationship, being your own person and spending time with yourself becomes difficult. When you start to develop this relationship, the path towards personal growth becomes less tumultuous.

Nurturing a relationship with yourself is important because it enhances your quality of life. When in a relationship with yourself, you can expect to:

Feel more confident

Look after yourself better

Strengthen your relationship with family and friends

Feel and look healthier

Solidify your independence

Learn to think positively

Having a relationship with yourself is a skill that can change your life. When you learn how to depend on yourself in your times of need, your problems become less stressful and easier to manage. Of course, this doesn’t mean that you need to be alone all the time, but when you’re going through a tough time and you can’t lean on anyone, there’s nothing better than knowing that you can power through it all by yourself.

How to Improve the Relationship You Have with Yourself
It is often said that you should treat yourself the way you would want a partner to treat you. However, a slightly better idea would be to take care of yourself as if you were your own child: with unconditional love and a lot of patience. A big part of this is practicing selfcare. Selfcare is an important aspect of living life, since it encourages you to live a healthier lifestyle.

Selfcare is all about doing what’s right for you. It involves taking care of your physical, mental, and emotional health. Not everyone is the same, which means that you need to take the time to experiment and set up a selfcare routine that works for you. We all have different things that we value in life, which is why it’s better to give a framework rather than a step-by-step guide.

Physical Health

When taking care of your physical health, it’s all paying attention to your body and giving it what it needs. Do not neglect any ailments you have and nurse your body when ill.

Exercise in a way that suits you and your goals. Do so not because you want to fit societal beauty standards, but because you love your body and want to give it the best. Don’t consider eating healthy food a “diet”. You are nourishing your body so that it functions as efficiently as possible.

Establish a hygiene routine that makes you feel good. You can find a safe space in many hygiene rituals that allow you to center yourself as you wash away all the negativity in your life.

Mental Health

Depending on how you handle stress, you can take care of yourself by either reaching out to others or spending some one-on-one time with your thoughts. If you are stressed, it’s important that you carve some time out of your day in order to address the negativity, process your emotions, and let them out in a productive way. It's beneficial that you learn how to do this by both relying on others and on your own.

Emotional Health

A relationship with ourselves requires us to address our emotional needs in a healthy way. This is one of the most difficult aspects of selfcare because in order to handle our emotions, we must first confront them. Human beings have a tendency to ignore our emotions in order to maintain a certain cognitive stability.

You can break free from these mental traps by paying attention to your mental health. This will give you the clarity you need to address your emotions in a healthy way.

The Relationship You Have with Yourself Is the Most Complicated
Because of the way our mind works, we tend to have an incredibly complicated relationship with ourselves. Aside from the society we live in, the way we naturally process emotional trauma affects how we view ourselves.

Luckily, the concept of a self-relationship has been studied extensively in many areas of life, from a religious, psychological, artistic, and scientific point of view. The many ways that exist of having a relationship with yourself gives us a good framework from which to work on.

Still, because there are so many paths you can take when it comes to a self-relationship, it can be overwhelming. In order to un-complicate a relationship with yourself, you can do the following:

Set goals for yourself

Try to be consistent with your selflove

Understand that developing a relationship with yourself takes time

Reach out and get help

If you need additional help, you can look into other resources for some guidance. Books like Grit & Grace: 7 Steps to Survive Heartbreak are great tools that can help with goal-setting, tracking your growth, and making the development of a self-relationship a lot simpler.

What to Do When Your Relationship with Yourself Falters
The relationship you have with yourself is the most important one, but maintaining it isn’t always easy. If you ever realize that you’re having difficulty maintaining a self-relationship, don’t dwell on it too much. Just as partners argue every now and again and children and parents clash, the relationship people have with themselves contains bumps on the road.

What you do is continue prioritizing the things that make you feel centered and at peace. Before you know it, you’ll have picked yourself back up.

# [5 Reasons Why Maintaining a Healthy Relationship with Yourself Is Important](https://www.jillianturecki.com/blog/why-maintaining-a-healthy-relationship-with-yourself-is-important)

2How to have a relationship with yourself is unfortunately not something we are taught despite how important it is. Maintaining a healthy relationship with yourself is important because of how it affects the way we move through life. A healthy self-relationship opens the door to a life of independence, emotional stability, and a better lifestyle. Here are 5 reasons why you should take the time to develop a healthy relationship with yourself.

What Happens When I Am in a Relationship with Myself?
Learning how to have a relationship with yourself is one of the most rewarding things you can do in life. We live in a time when our lives are filled with noises and distractions that make it difficult to focus on ourselves and develop this relationship. Once you take the time to start a self-relationship, you’ll notice that a lot of things in your day-to-day life become a lot easier. Among the many benefits a self-relationship brings, you can expect 5 things to happen, such as:

1. You Can Count on Yourself When Nobody Else Can
Having a lot of people you can rely on in your life is a wonderful thing, but there may come a time when the only person in your corner is yourself. If you don’t have a healthy relationship with yourself, you may find that standing up for yourself can be hard when you’re all alone.

It is often said that having a relationship with yourself means treating yourself how you would want a partner to treat you. This means being able to provide yourself with emotional support you need, being able to look out for your wellbeing, and prioritizing yourself when the situation calls for it. Being able to do these things when others aren’t able to is part of the personal development that’s needed to avoid harmful attitudes of co-dependency.

2. It Improves Your Relationship with Others
Developing a relationship with yourself is setting yourself on the right path of life mastery, a skill that is not only beneficial to you, but to others as well. Being able to handle yourself out in the world provides you with the wisdom needed to help those around you. You can learn to help others by first learning how to help yourself.

Being in a happy relationship with yourself also helps you learn to enjoy life. The love that you give yourself will radiate outwards. The people around you will notice, and because positivity is infectious, they will feel happy when around you too.

3. It Will Give You a Confidence Boost
Nothing can give you more confidence than knowing that you can count on yourself to get you through difficult times. People with confidence are those that live their life believing they can do anything. The more you go through life surpassing obstacle after obstacle, the more confidence you will have. If you have a good relationship with yourself, going through these obstacles only gets easier.

4. It Will Make You Happier
When in a relationship with yourself, you become happier. Because you are taking care of yourself so well, your body and mind will feel refreshed. Going through life with this new-found clarity relieves a lot of weight off your shoulders and opens the path towards living life with more positive thoughts.

Part of having a self-relationship also means watching out for your mental health. When you’re emotionally available, you can engage in more activities, spend time with others, and revel in happy moments more often. Being able to do all of these are key ingredients in the recipe for a more joyous life.

5. Your Problem-Solving Skills Will Improve
Being in a relationship with yourself means disengaging from things that harm you. When you develop this ability, you are able to remove yourself from stressful situations and look at things objectively. Whether it’s cutting off a bad friendship, getting a better job, or knowing when to seek a safe space, when you are in a relationship with yourself, seemingly big problems have a tendency to become smaller.

How Do I Know If I Am in a Relationship with Myself?
It may be difficult to know if you’re on the right track when it comes to a self-relationship. While a relationship with yourself can provide you with extensive benefits, it can be a bit of a challenge to know if you are reaping those benefits in the first place.

If you need a guideline that will help you track your progress, you can always refer to the book Grit & Grace: 7 Steps to Survive Heartbreak. Inside, you’ll find helpful resources that will aid you in understanding where you are in your journey towards personal growth.

How to Have a Relationship with Yourself
Having a relationship with yourself is all about knowing what makes you happiest in life. When you love yourself, you’re able to spend time alone with yourself, enjoy your own company, take a step back from stressful situations and do what’s best for yourself, and have a health-focused lifestyle.

In order to have a healthy relationship with yourself, you need to be able to take care of your physical, mental, and emotional needs. This can be done with basic selfcare activities, such as:

Having mental health check-ups

Spending time with loved ones

Engaging in your favorite hobbies

Having a healthy relationship with your body

Reducing negative self-talk

Starting off with these basic selfcare activities will set you on the right path towards inner peace and self-love. It's important to note that the energy that you use to engage in these activities will determine the degree of your success. These practices must come from a place of wanting better for yourself because you deserve it, not because you want to do it for other people.

Exercise and eat healthy because it’s good for your body first and because you want to look a certain way second. Spend time with your friends because you enjoy their company, not because you feel like you have to complete some sort of social obligation.

Coming from a genuine place when doing all of this may not come naturally at first, especially if having a relationship with yourself is brand new territory. Luckily, practice makes perfect, and soon enough, your self-relationship will flourish and blossom into something that will enhance your attitude towards life.

# [How to Live for Yourself in a Relationship](https://www.jillianturecki.com/blog/how-to-live-for-yourself-in-a-relationship)

Being in a relationship is a beautiful, exciting thing. More than just making us feel giddy and giving us butterflies, relationships can actually alter us at a neurochemical level. According to a study published in Psychoneuroendocrinology, a high amount of oxytocin (commonly referred to as the love hormone) is found in the brain composition of new lovers.

While the release of oxytocin does wonders for our happiness levels when in a relationship, it can blind us to the point where we begin to neglect ourselves. Taking care of yourself while in a relationship is something that must not be forgotten, no matter how “addicted” we feel towards our partner. Not only do you owe it to yourself to practice selflove, but taking time to do so will also improve your relationship with your romantic partner.

Being Your Own Person in a Relationship
It is often said that, given enough time, two people in a relationship will morph together into one person. This refers to the fact that, when you spend a lot of time with someone, especially someone you care for, a lot of their personality traits begin to rub off on you. This behavior isn’t necessarily a bad thing and, for the most part, it is rather unavoidable.

Like everything in life, however, being your own person while in a relationship is all about balance. There's nothing wrong with spending time with your partner, adopting their mannerisms, and wanting to be with them often, but you also need to recognize when it’s time to step back a little.

Doing so benefits the relationship in multiple ways, such as:

Enhancing the quality of the time spent between you and your partner

Allowing yourself time for selfcare

Allowing you to set boundaries

Reducing the risk of neglecting yourself and your other loved ones

Allowing you to maintain your independence

Allowing you to stay true to yourself and your beliefs

Overall, being your own person in a relationship allows you to maintain your sense of self. Having a clear vision of who you are while you grow in life alongside your partner comes in handy during times when you need to do challenging things without their support. This benefits yourself and your partner because it allows for a more equal, healthy relationship in which co-dependency, distrust, and caregiver fatigue are non-existent.

How to Be Your Best Self in a Relationship
Taking care of yourself while in a relationship is an important part of personal growth. When you are in a good place mentally and emotionally, you are able to enjoy and appreciate your relationship a lot more. To be your best self while in a relationship, you need to take the time to practice selfcare.

Selfcare involves taking care of yourself in the physical, emotional, and mental sense. When you practice selfcare, you’ll be able to maintain your individualism while in the relationship, as well as stay focused and healthy enough to enjoy it to the fullest.

When it comes to basic physical selfcare, you should focus on:

Having a personal hygiene routine

Getting routine health checkups

Eating healthy

Exercising

When it comes to emotional selfcare, you should focus on:

Engaging in creative hobbies

Spending quality time with loved ones

Doing and seeing things that make you laugh

Taking the time to disengage from stressful situations

Last but not least, mental selfcare often involves:

Seeing a mental health professional

Opening up to your loved ones

Taking the time to process your emotions

Giving your emotions an outlet

These are only some of the things you can do to practice selfcare. It takes time to learn what works and what doesn’t, so don’t worry about feeling frustrated if you have trouble “getting it”.

The key to it all is selfcare and selflove. Focusing on yourself from time to time heals the heart and allows you to grow as a person. Being your best self is a personal journey, even when you have a supportive partner by your side.

How to Work on Yourself in a Relationship
It's very easy to lose yourself when in a relationship. As your world merges with that of another person, dealing with your personal problems becomes a lot more complicated as you open your heart and mind to your significant other.

Just because you’re in a relationship does not mean that you have to stop working on yourself. You can still work towards self-improvement without neglecting your lover. The idea that personal growth and self-improvement is a solitary path is a misguided one, as there is no better way to grow than by surrounding yourself with those who care about you dearly.

Working on yourself while in a relationship is all about setting boundaries. When you set boundaries, set certain rules that establish your agency in the relationship. These rules can be anything that helps you in developing selflove and keep a healthy balance between your independence and your place in the relationship.

Stay firm on your boundaries and communicate with your partner. These two things will make it incredibly easy to work on yourself while in a relationship.

Taking Care of Yourself in a Relationship
Treat yourself to some kindness while in a relationship. Take care of yourself and don’t be afraid to lean on your partner every now and then when things get rough. While selfcare is something that you mainly do by yourself for yourself, there’s nothing wrong with allowing your partner to care for you from time to time.

You should take care of yourself as much as your partner does. If you notice that this isn’t the case, you can check out Grit & Grace: 7 Steps to Survive Heartbreak. It’s a book that can be applied to many aspects of life, and it serves as guidance when you are struggling with feeling good about yourself.

How to Be Yourself in a Relationship
A happy relationship is one where both partners can be themselves in. Don't be afraid of being who you truly are around your partner. Honesty and truth are great foundations from which you can build a long-lasting relationship with your partner.

Allow yourself to unwind and speak your mind when in their presence, and don’t think too much about coming off as weird. We all have charming little quirks that make us who we are, so when you open yourself up, your partner will find you even more endearing.
